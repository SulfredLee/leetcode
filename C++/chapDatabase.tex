\section{Combine Two Tables} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:combine-two-tables}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Person
\begin{Code}
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
\end{Code}

Table: Address
\begin{Code}
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

\subsubsection{outer join}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is
  // no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
SELECT
    FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM
    Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON
    Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID
;
\end{Code}

\section{Second Highest Salary} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:second-highest-salary}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Employee
\begin{Code}
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
\end{Code}

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
\begin{Code}
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

\subsubsection{sub-query and LIMIT clause}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Use a sub-query to handle only one record in this table
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
        Salary
     FROM
         Employee
     ORDER BY Salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
\end{Code}

\subsubsection{IFNULL and LIMIT}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Use a sub-query to handle only one record in this table
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT
           Salary
       FROM
           Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
       LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
\end{Code}

\section{Nth Highest Salary} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:nth-highest-salary}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Employee
\begin{Code}
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
\end{Code}

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.
\begin{Code}
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

\subsubsection{IFNULL and LIMIT}
\begin{Code}
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN

SET N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select
          ifnull(
              (select distinct
                   salary
               from
                   employee
               order by  salary desc
               limit N,1),
          null)
  );
END
\end{Code}
