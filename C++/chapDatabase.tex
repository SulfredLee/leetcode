\section{Combine Two Tables} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:combine-two-tables}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Person
\begin{Code}
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
\end{Code}

Table: Address
\begin{Code}
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

\subsubsection{outer join}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is
  // no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
SELECT
    FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM
    Person LEFT JOIN Address
ON
    Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID
;
\end{Code}

\section{Second Highest Salary} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:second-highest-salary}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Employee
\begin{Code}
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
\end{Code}

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.
\begin{Code}
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

\subsubsection{sub-query and LIMIT clause}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Use a sub-query to handle only one record in this table
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
        Salary
     FROM
         Employee
     ORDER BY Salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
\end{Code}

\subsubsection{IFNULL and LIMIT}
\begin{Code}
  // Note: Use a sub-query to handle only one record in this table
SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT
           Salary
       FROM
           Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
       LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
\end{Code}

\section{Nth Highest Salary} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:nth-highest-salary}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

Table: Employee
\begin{Code}
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
\end{Code}

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.
\begin{Code}
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

\subsubsection{IFNULL and LIMIT}
\begin{Code}
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN

SET N=N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select
          ifnull(
              (select distinct
                   salary
               from
                   employee
               order by  salary desc
               limit N,1),
          null)
  );
END
\end{Code}

\section{Rank Scores} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:rank-scores}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

\begin{Code}
Create table If Not Exists Scores (Id int, Score DECIMAL(3,2))
Truncate table Scores
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('1', '3.5')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('2', '3.65')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('3', '4.0')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('4', '3.85')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('5', '4.0')
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('6', '3.65')
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

Table: Scores
\begin{Code}
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
\end{Code}

For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
\begin{Code}
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
\end{Code}

\textbf{Important Note}: For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example `Rank`.

\subsubsection{Dense_Rank}
\begin{Code}
SELECT Score, dense_rank() OVER(ORDER BY Score DESC) AS `Rank` FROM Scores;
\end{Code}

\section{Consecutive Numbers} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:consecutive-numbers}


\subsubsection{描述}
SQL Schema

\begin{Code}
Create table If Not Exists Logs (Id int, Num int)
Truncate table Logs
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('1', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('2', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('3', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('4', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('5', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('6', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('7', '2')
\end{Code}

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example:

Table: Logs
\begin{Code}
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
\end{Code}


\begin{Code}
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
\end{Code}


\subsubsection{multiple table}
\begin{Code}
SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
\end{Code}

A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:
\begin{Code}
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+

In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees
\end{Code}

Table: Trips

\begin{Code}
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Id          | int      |
| Client_Id   | int      |
| Driver_Id   | int      |
| City_Id     | int      |
| Status      | enum     |
| Request_at  | date     |     
+-------------+----------+
Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table.
Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).
\end{Code}

Table: Users

\begin{Code}
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| Users_Id    | int      |
| Banned      | enum     |
| Role        | enum     |
+-------------+----------+
Users_Id is the primary key for this table.
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique Users_Id, and Role is an ENUM type of (‘client’, ‘driver’, ‘partner’).
Status is an ENUM type of (‘Yes’, ‘No’).
\end{Code}

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

The query result format is in the following example:

\begin{Code}

+------------+-------------------+

On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
